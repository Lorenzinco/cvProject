# Computer Vision Project

This is our take on the project for the computer vision course at the master in computer science in Sapienza, university of Rome.

The project consists on an application built on top of the hand recognition model provided by google [Mediapipe](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker).

The application consists on recognizing different gestures performed by the user while presenting slides or during meetings such as swipes or pointing directly at the screen.

### Features
- #### Pointing at the screen
While using the application, by pointing at the builtin camera of your laptop you can move your laptop's cursor to the pointed direction.

- #### Swipe left or right
You can also swipe your hand to the left or the right to go either forward or backward on the slides you're presenting. If you wish to assign those movements to a different action you can do so by editing the main.py file.
